Hi, guys. This should be my first project (and perhaps too big) but it will help me learn more about coding on the way, and
if it allows others to get inspired and continue the vision, then the community is the winner from this.

Alright, so I'm a market board moogle, and I spend a lot of time buying, crafting, and selling. I also come from WoW, so I'm used to having
access to a lot of addons that help me do all those things or cut corners, or external websites like _The Undermine Journal_, that allow users to get auction house info outside of 
WoW client through the game's API. FF14 stated that they don't want the same thing, and don't want any addon interacting with the client or
any of its files, as a respectable choice given their vision. I want to work on a program that would be standalone but would still give information and keep personal information
all well organized by the user. I currently use papers, wordpad, and a custom googlesheet I put together, but would rather a framework to be able to make 
money faster and get the data I want faster all in one.

  * I want to reduce having to Search google item XY for components.
  * I want to see ALL the components involved in compact, but extended display. This may be difficult, but config could be controlled to 
  limits.
  * Keeping notes, and favoriting items for buy list.
  * If Item right clicked, will show own page and every craft involved and important information on item. (or rc show's own component)
  * If Item left clicked, item's name will go to clipboard, so you can paste in FF14 to buy or search.
  * Items of preference will allow users to input current prices and build database over time.
  * I want to see if it's possible to have secured accounts. Very limited, except for the data on personal prices, which enriches database.
  * Customizable for personal needs -- recognizes trends. Unlikely to come with the core.
  * Color displayed items of crafting priority based on past trends. Identify profitable markets.
  * Module for timed spawns: Fishing, Miner, Botanists.
  * Timer set on AZ timer to keep track.
  * More to come...
