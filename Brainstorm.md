# Brainstorm

## 29th Jan 2016:

Hi, guys. This should be my first project (and perhaps too big) but it will help me learn more about coding on the way, and
if it allows others to get inspired and continue the vision, then the community is the winner from this.

Alright, so I'm a market board moogle, and I spend a lot of time buying, crafting, and selling. I also come from WoW, so I'm used to having
access to a lot of addons that help selling, or external websites like Theunderminejournal, that allow users to get info outside of 
WoW through the game's API. FF14 stated that they don't want the same thing, and don't want any addon interacting with the client or
any of its files. I want to work on a program that would be standalone but would still give information and keep personal information
all well organized by the user. I currently use both papers and random notes on a notepad, but want a framework to be able to make 
money faster and get the data I want faster.

  * I want to reduce having to Search google item XY for components.
  * I want to see ALL the components involved in compact, but extended display. This may be difficult, but config could be controlled to 
  limits.
  * Keeping notes, and favoriting items for buy list.
  * If Item right clicked, will show own page and every craft involved and important information on item. (or rc show's own component)
  * If Item left clicked, item's name will go to clipboard, so you can paste in FF14 to buy or search.
  * Items of preference will allow users to input current prices and build database over time.
  * I want to see if it's possible to have secured accounts. Very limited, except for the data on personal prices, which enriches database.
  * Customizable for personal needs.
  * More to come...
